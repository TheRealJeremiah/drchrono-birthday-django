# Overview
- python-social-auth is used for authentication
- an api route is created to handle requests to drchono and return a parsed version to the frontend
- list of patients from this api is used to populate a calendar on the frontend and add email links
- right now a doctor has to manually send reminders, but in the future there could be integration with an emailing api like sendgrid
